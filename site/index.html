        <p>Google Chrome will soon introduce a set of restrictions called "Manifest V3".</p>
        <p><b>These changes pose a threat to users.</b></p>

          Manifest V3 harms your privacy efforts by restricting web extensions, including ad blockers, that you are
          likely to use.

            conducted in 2020 by scientists from Princeton University and the University of Chicago.</a>
          has shown that privacy extensions, the very same ones that Manifest will thwart
          V3, actually improve browser performance.

          was stated "... malicious add-ons are mainly interested in capturing bad data, they can still
          do so using the current webRequest API, which is not blocked". In plain language, this means that
          when a malicious extension sneaks through the security check process, it's usually interested in
          simply observing the communication between your browser and the websites you visit. Malicious
          activity takes place elsewhere, after the data has already been read.
          <br />
          A more thorough process for vetting extensions could improve security, but Chrome hasn't stated
          that they would do so. Instead, they've decided to limit the capabilities of all extensions.

          But you shouldn't take this article at its word. Here are a few thoughts from technologists, privacy
          advocates, and extension developers who share concerns about Manifest V3:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "A web browser is supposed to act on behalf of the user and respect the user's interests. Unfortunately,
          Chrome now has
          a track record as a Google agent, not a user agent. It is the only major web browser that lacks meaningful
          privacy
          protections by default, shoves users toward linking activity with a Google Account, and implements invasive
          new
          advertising capabilities. Google's latest changes will break Chrome privacy extensions, despite academic
          research
          demonstrating that no change is necessary. These user-hostile decisions are all directly attributable to
          Google's
          surveillance business model and enabled by its dominance of the desktop browser market."
          <br />
          <i>- Jonathan Mayer, Princeton University</i>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          “Of all the browser extension API revolutions I've seen in 16 years of NoScript development, Manifest V3 is
          the worst
          offender by a long shot: a huge step backwards, and a poorly justified one. Manifest V3 shrinks extension
          capabilities
          and Web users' freedom to customize their browsing experience.

          While there are many reasons to doubt the claimed privacy improvements and the theoretical performance gains,
          the
          disruption for existing extensions is painfully real: non-trivial extensions will need to be rewritten, in
          cases forced
          to abandon fundamental features.

          But even worse is the severe crunch on browser extensions developers' ability to innovate, and, in the case of
          privacy
          and security extensions, to respond to emerging threats promptly and creatively. The net loss is huge, for
          developers
          but most importantly for web users' online safety and freedom of choice.”

        <blockquote>
          “For SingleFile, I consider the migration to Manifest V3 to be a major regression from a functional and
          technical point
          of view. It also undermines some of the work done. Unfortunately, it doesn't bring any gains in return for the
          users. It
          is the very example of the collateral damage the Manifest V3 can cause.”
